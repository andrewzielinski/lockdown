h2. What

Lockdown is a authentication/authorization system for RubyOnRails (ver 2.x). While Merb functionality is in place, it is not complete.  There will be a release solely focused on getting the Merb functionality up to par with Rails.

h2. New Home

Maintaining this page, the wiki at GitHub, the Google Group and no issue tracker is not an ideal setup.  So, everything is moving to "stonean.com":http://stonean.com where I'm giving "Redmine":http://redmine.org a shot a running everything for me. I'll be posting release announcements to the news feed for each project and keeping the docs up-to-date.  Hopefully this will be better for everyone.
